# complete_CSharp_masterclass


## About
This repository will hold each course exercise and project done using the complete C# Masterclass.
There will be a new solution for each course section. Most if not all of the section code have been 
commented in order to clean the console output and only display the latest and currently worked on code.
If you wish to run each separate code examples, please uncomment all the code in between the sections.
Sections are separated by the following comments

// =================================================
// =========== Section Title Goes Here =============
// =================================================

These titles specify what is currently being worked on, 
whether it be a coding challenge or course section examples
in order to understand the basic concepts.
